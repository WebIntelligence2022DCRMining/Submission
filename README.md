This repository contains various ressources for the submitted paper:

- datasets/ contains the 2 datasets used in the experiments
- schema/ contains the schema describing the datasets used in the experiments
- mined_rules/ contains the rules mined over the 2 datasets
- models_performances/ shows the embedding models performances over the 2 datasets
- DCREmbeddings/ contains:
- two folders containing code to mine DCR (dcr_discovery/ and similarity_search/)
- tutorials/ that shows how to use our code to mine DCR on KGs by applying our functions in a tutorial. It also shows the experiment done in the paper.
